Like the unix {\ttfamily which} utility.

Finds the first instance of a specified executable in the P\+A\+TH environment variable. Does not cache the results, so {\ttfamily hash -\/r} is not needed when the P\+A\+TH changes.

You may pass an options object as the second argument.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily path}\+: Use instead of the {\ttfamily P\+A\+TH} environment variable.
\item {\ttfamily path\+Ext}\+: Use instead of the {\ttfamily P\+A\+T\+H\+E\+XT} environment variable.
\item {\ttfamily all}\+: Return all matches, instead of just the first one. Note that this means the function returns an array of strings instead of a single string.
