\doxysection*{What\textquotesingle{}s in the folder}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
\item {\ttfamily package.\+json} -\/ this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesnâ€™t yet need to load the plugin.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily extension.\+js} -\/ this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The file exports one function, {\ttfamily activate}, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the {\ttfamily activate} function we call {\ttfamily register\+Command}.
\item We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to {\ttfamily register\+Command}.
