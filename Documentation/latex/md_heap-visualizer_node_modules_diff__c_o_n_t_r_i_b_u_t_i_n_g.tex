\doxysection*{Pull Requests}

We also accept \href{https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/new/master}{\texttt{ pull requests}}!

Generally we like to see pull requests that
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Maintain the existing code style
\item Are focused on a single change (i.\+e. avoid large refactoring or style adjustments in untouched code if not the primary goal of the pull request)
\item Have \href{http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html}{\texttt{ good commit messages}}
\item Have tests
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t decrease the current code coverage (see coverage/lcov-\/report/index.\+html)
\end{DoxyItemize}
