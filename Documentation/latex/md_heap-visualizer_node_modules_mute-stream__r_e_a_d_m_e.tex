Bytes go in, but they don\textquotesingle{}t come out (when muted).

This is a basic pass-\/through stream, but when muted, the bytes are silently dropped, rather than being passed through.

\doxysection*{Usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{var MuteStream = require('mute-\/stream')}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{var ms = new MuteStream(options)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{ms.pipe(process.stdout)}
\DoxyCodeLine{ms.write('foo') // writes 'foo' to stdout}
\DoxyCodeLine{ms.mute()}
\DoxyCodeLine{ms.write('bar') // does not write 'bar'}
\DoxyCodeLine{ms.unmute()}
\DoxyCodeLine{ms.write('baz') // writes 'baz' to stdout}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// can also be used to mute incoming data}
\DoxyCodeLine{var ms = new MuteStream}
\DoxyCodeLine{input.pipe(ms)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{ms.on('data', function (c) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  console.log('data: ' + c)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\})}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{input.emit('data', 'foo') // logs 'foo'}
\DoxyCodeLine{ms.mute()}
\DoxyCodeLine{input.emit('data', 'bar') // does not log 'bar'}
\DoxyCodeLine{ms.unmute()}
\DoxyCodeLine{input.emit('data', 'baz') // logs 'baz'}
\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysection*{Options}

All options are optional.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily replace} Set to a string to replace each character with the specified string when muted. (So you can show {\ttfamily $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} instead of the password, for example.)
\item {\ttfamily prompt} If you are using a replacement char, and also using a prompt with a readline stream (as for a {\ttfamily Password\+: $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} input), then specify what the prompt is so that backspace will work properly. Otherwise, pressing backspace will overwrite the prompt with the replacement character, which is weird.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{ms.\+mute()}

Set {\ttfamily muted} to {\ttfamily true}. Turns {\ttfamily .write()} into a no-\/op.

\doxysection*{ms.\+unmute()}

Set {\ttfamily muted} to {\ttfamily false}

\doxysection*{ms.\+is\+T\+TY}

True if the pipe destination is a T\+TY, or if the incoming pipe source is a T\+TY.

\doxysection*{Other stream methods...}

The other standard readable and writable stream methods are all available. The Mute\+Stream object acts as a facade to its pipe source and destination.
