\DoxyCodeLine{var align = require('wide-\/align')}

These functions were originally taken from \href{https://npmjs.com/package/cliui}{\texttt{ cliui}}. Changes include switching to the M\+U\+CH faster pad generation function from \href{https://npmjs.com/package/lodash}{\texttt{ lodash}}, making center alignment pad both sides and adding left alignment.
