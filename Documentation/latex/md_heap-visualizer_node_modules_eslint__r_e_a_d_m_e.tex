\href{https://eslint.org}{\texttt{ Website}} $\vert$ \href{https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring}{\texttt{ Configuring}} $\vert$ \href{https://eslint.org/docs/rules/}{\texttt{ Rules}} $\vert$ \href{https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing}{\texttt{ Contributing}} $\vert$ \href{https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/reporting-bugs}{\texttt{ Reporting Bugs}} $\vert$ \href{https://js.foundation/community/code-of-conduct}{\texttt{ Code of Conduct}} $\vert$ \href{https://twitter.com/geteslint}{\texttt{ Twitter}} $\vert$ \href{https://groups.google.com/group/eslint}{\texttt{ Mailing List}} $\vert$ \href{https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint}{\texttt{ Chat Room}}

E\+S\+Lint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in E\+C\+M\+A\+Script/\+Java\+Script code. In many ways, it is similar to J\+S\+Lint and J\+S\+Hint with a few exceptions\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item E\+S\+Lint uses \href{https://github.com/eslint/espree}{\texttt{ Espree}} for Java\+Script parsing.
\item E\+S\+Lint uses an A\+ST to evaluate patterns in code.
\item E\+S\+Lint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{\label{_installation-and-usage}%
Installation and Usage}

Prerequisites\+: \href{https://nodejs.org/}{\texttt{ Node.\+js}} ({\ttfamily $^\wedge$8.10.\+0}, {\ttfamily $^\wedge$10.13.\+0}, or {\ttfamily $>$=11.\+10.\+1}) built with S\+SL support. (If you are using an official Node.\+js distribution, S\+SL is always built in.)

You can install E\+S\+Lint using npm\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ npm install eslint -\/-\/save-\/dev}
\end{DoxyCode}


You should then set up a configuration file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ ./node\_modules/.bin/eslint -\/-\/init}
\end{DoxyCode}


After that, you can run E\+S\+Lint on any file or directory like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ ./node\_modules/.bin/eslint yourfile.js}
\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysubsection*{\label{_configuration}%
Configuration}

After running {\ttfamily eslint -\/-\/init}, you\textquotesingle{}ll have a {\ttfamily .eslintrc} file in your directory. In it, you\textquotesingle{}ll see some rules configured like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "rules": \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "semi": ["error", "always"],}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "quotes": ["error", "double"]}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


The names {\ttfamily \char`\"{}semi\char`\"{}} and {\ttfamily \char`\"{}quotes\char`\"{}} are the names of \href{https://eslint.org/docs/rules}{\texttt{ rules}} in E\+S\+Lint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}off\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily 0} -\/ turn the rule off
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}warn\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily 1} -\/ turn the rule on as a warning (doesn\textquotesingle{}t affect exit code)
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}error\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily 2} -\/ turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The three error levels allow you fine-\/grained control over how E\+S\+Lint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the \href{https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring}{\texttt{ configuration docs}}).

\doxysubsection*{\label{_code-of-conduct}%

\doxysubsection*{\label{_faq}%
Frequently Asked Questions}

\doxysubsubsection*{I\textquotesingle{}m using J\+S\+CS, should I migrate to E\+S\+Lint?}

Yes. \href{https://eslint.org/blog/2016/07/jscs-end-of-life}{\texttt{ J\+S\+CS has reached end of life}} and is no longer supported.

We have prepared a \href{https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/migrating-from-jscs}{\texttt{ migration guide}} to help you convert your J\+S\+CS settings to an E\+S\+Lint configuration.

We are now at or near 100\% compatibility with J\+S\+CS. If you try E\+S\+Lint and believe we are not yet compatible with a J\+S\+CS rule/configuration, please create an issue (mentioning that it is a J\+S\+CS compatibility issue) and we will evaluate it as per our normal process.

\doxysubsubsection*{Does Prettier replace E\+S\+Lint?}

No, E\+S\+Lint does both traditional linting (looking for problematic patterns) and style checking (enforcement of conventions). You can use E\+S\+Lint for everything, or you can combine both using Prettier to format your code and E\+S\+Lint to catch possible errors.

\doxysubsubsection*{Why can\textquotesingle{}t E\+S\+Lint find my plugins?}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure your plugins (and E\+S\+Lint) are both in your project\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily package.\+json} as dev\+Dependencies (or dependencies, if your project uses E\+S\+Lint at runtime).
\item Make sure you have run {\ttfamily npm install} and all your dependencies are installed.
\item Make sure your plugins\textquotesingle{} peer\+Dependencies have been installed as well. You can use {\ttfamily npm view eslint-\/plugin-\/myplugin peer\+Dependencies} to see what peer dependencies {\ttfamily eslint-\/plugin-\/myplugin} has.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsection*{Does E\+S\+Lint support J\+SX?}

Yes, E\+S\+Lint natively supports parsing J\+SX syntax (this must be enabled in \href{https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring}{\texttt{ configuration}}). Please note that supporting J\+SX syntax {\itshape is not} the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to J\+SX syntax that E\+S\+Lint doesn\textquotesingle{}t recognize. We recommend using \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react}{\texttt{ eslint-\/plugin-\/react}} if you are using React and want React semantics.

\doxysubsubsection*{What E\+C\+M\+A\+Script versions does E\+S\+Lint support?}

E\+S\+Lint has full support for E\+C\+M\+A\+Script 3, 5 (default), 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. You can set your desired E\+C\+M\+A\+Script syntax (and other settings, like global variables or your target environments) through \href{https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring}{\texttt{ configuration}}.

\doxysubsubsection*{What about experimental features?}

E\+S\+Lint\textquotesingle{}s parser only officially supports the latest final E\+C\+M\+A\+Script standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 E\+C\+M\+A\+Script syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental E\+S\+Tree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as J\+SX, Flow, and Type\+Script) on a case-\/by-\/case basis.

In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use the \href{https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint}{\texttt{ babel-\/eslint}} parser and \href{https://github.com/babel/eslint-plugin-babel}{\texttt{ eslint-\/plugin-\/babel}} to use any option available in Babel.

Once a language feature has been adopted into the E\+C\+M\+A\+Script standard (stage 4 according to the \href{https://tc39.github.io/process-document/}{\texttt{ T\+C39 process}}), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our \href{https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing}{\texttt{ contributing guidelines}}. Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.

\doxysubsection*{\label{_releases}%
Releases}

We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday. You can follow a \href{https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is\%3Aopen+is\%3Aissue+label\%3Arelease}{\texttt{ release issue}} for updates about the scheduling of any particular release.

\doxysubsection*{\label{_semantic-versioning-policy}%
Semantic Versioning Policy}

E\+S\+Lint follows \href{https://semver.org}{\texttt{ semantic versioning}}. However, due to the nature of E\+S\+Lint as a code quality tool, it\textquotesingle{}s not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we\textquotesingle{}ve defined the following semantic versioning policy for E\+S\+Lint\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Patch release (intended to not break your lint build)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A bug fix in a rule that results in E\+S\+Lint reporting fewer errors.
\item A bug fix to the C\+LI or core (including formatters).
\item Improvements to documentation.
\item Non-\/user-\/facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage.
\item Re-\/releasing after a failed release (i.\+e., publishing a release that doesn\textquotesingle{}t work for anyone).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Minor release (might break your lint build)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A bug fix in a rule that results in E\+S\+Lint reporting more errors.
\item A new rule is created.
\item A new option to an existing rule that does not result in E\+S\+Lint reporting more errors by default.
\item An existing rule is deprecated.
\item A new C\+LI capability is created.
\item New capabilities to the public A\+PI are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).
\item A new formatter is created.
\item {\ttfamily eslint\+:recommended} is updated and will result in strictly fewer errors (e.\+g., rule removals).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Major release (likely to break your lint build)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily eslint\+:recommended} is updated and may result in new errors (e.\+g., rule additions, most rule option updates).
\item A new option to an existing rule that results in E\+S\+Lint reporting more errors by default.
\item An existing formatter is removed.
\item Part of the public A\+PI is removed or changed in an incompatible way.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

According to our policy, any minor update may report more errors than the previous release (ex\+: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde ({\ttfamily $\sim$}) in {\ttfamily package.\+json} e.\+g. {\ttfamily \char`\"{}eslint\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}$\sim$3.\+1.\+0\char`\"{}} to guarantee the results of your builds.
