{\ttfamily require.\+main.\+filename} is great for figuring out the entry point for the current application. This can be combined with a module like \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg-conf}{\texttt{ pkg-\/conf}} to, {\itshape as if by magic}, load top-\/level configuration.

Unfortunately, {\ttfamily require.\+main.\+filename} sometimes fails when an application is executed with an alternative process manager, e.\+g., \href{https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode}{\texttt{ iisnode}}.

{\ttfamily require-\/main-\/filename} is a shim that addresses this problem.
